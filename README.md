# Introduction

Delta is a modern system programming language designed as an alternative to C++,
C, and Rust. The primary goals of Delta are programmer productivity and
performance. Memory safety is also a priority, but while Delta improves on what
C++ and C have to offer, it doesn't go as far as Rust at the detriment of
ergonomics.
